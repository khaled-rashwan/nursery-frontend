# Fix for Parent Attendance Access (403 Error)

## Issue Identified
Parents were getting 403 Forbidden error when trying to access their child's attendance because the API was checking for `studentInfo.parentUID` in enrollment documents, but this field is not reliably populated.

## Root Cause
The `getStudentAttendanceHistory` function was using an enrollment-based query to verify parent access:
```javascript
// OLD (PROBLEMATIC) CODE:
const studentEnrollmentQuery = await db.collection('enrollments')
  .where('studentUID', '==', studentId)
  .where('studentInfo.parentUID', '==', decodedToken.uid)
  .limit(1)
  .get();
```

This fails because:
1. `studentInfo.parentUID` is populated by enrichment logic, not always available
2. Enrollment documents may not have complete student info
3. The parent relationship is directly stored in the student document

## Solution Implemented
Changed to direct student document verification:
```javascript
// NEW (FIXED) CODE:
const studentDoc = await db.collection('students').doc(studentId).get();
if (!studentDoc.exists) {
  return res.status(404).json({ error: 'Student not found' });
}
const studentData = studentDoc.data();
if (studentData.parentUID !== decodedToken.uid) {
  return res.status(403).json({ error: 'Access denied: Not authorized to view this student\'s attendance' });
}
```

## Files Modified
1. `functions/functions/src/attendance/attendanceCrudNew.js` - Fixed parent authorization in `getStudentAttendanceHistory` function
2. `functions/functions/src/attendance/attendanceCrudNew.js` - Fixed parent filtering in `getAttendanceCentralized` function

## Benefits
1. **More Reliable**: Uses direct student-parent relationship from students collection
2. **Faster**: Single document read instead of complex enrollment query
3. **Consistent**: Works regardless of enrollment data completeness
4. **Secure**: Still maintains proper parent-child access control

## Testing Required
1. Test parent login and attendance access
2. Verify only authorized parents can see their children's data
3. Confirm error handling for non-existent students
4. Test with multiple children per parent

## Deployment Steps
1. Deploy the Firebase Functions with the updated code
2. Test with existing parent accounts
3. Verify the 403 error is resolved
4. Monitor for any new issues

## Verification
After deployment, the URL:
`https://us-central1-future-step-nursery.cloudfunctions.net/getStudentAttendanceHistory?studentId=9RTHNwq3Bb7KWjIIbDRZ`

Should return attendance data instead of 403 error for authorized parents.
