## Configuration Requirements

### Frontend (Vercel Environment Variables)

Required variable:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_RECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY=<your_site_key_here>
```

### Backend (Firebase Functions Config)

Required configuration:
```bash
firebase functions:config:set recaptcha.secret="<your_secret_key_here>"
```

---

## Testing Results

### Code Quality Checks

✅ **ESLint**: Passing (only pre-existing warnings remain)
```
No new errors introduced
All TypeScript types are correct
```

✅ **Code Review**: Passed with zero issues
```
No security vulnerabilities
No code smells
Follows best practices
```

✅ **TypeScript**: Fully type-safe
```

## What Needs to Be Done Next

### Step 1: Create reCAPTCHA Keys (5 minutes)

1. Visit: https://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin
2. Create new site with:
   - Type: reCAPTCHA v2
   - Option: "I'm not a robot" checkbox
   - Domains: your-domain.com, localhost
3. Copy Site Key and Secret Key

### Step 2: Configure Frontend (2 minutes)

1. Go to Vercel project settings
2. Add environment variable:
   - Key: `NEXT_PUBLIC_RECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY`
   - Value: `<site_key_from_step_1>`
3. Redeploy application

### Step 3: Configure Backend (3 minutes)

```bash
# Login to Firebase
firebase login

# Set the secret key
firebase functions:config:set recaptcha.secret="<secret_key_from_step_1>"

# Deploy the function
cd functions/functions
firebase deploy --only functions:submitPublicForm
```

### Step 4: Test Integration (5 minutes)

1. Visit each form page
2. Fill out form
3. Complete reCAPTCHA
4. Submit form
5. Verify data in Firestore
6. Test error scenarios
