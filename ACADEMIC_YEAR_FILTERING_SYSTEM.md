# Academic Year Filtering System

## Overview
Added comprehensive academic year filtering across the nursery management system with automatic current year detection based on the August-July academic calendar.

## Academic Year Logic

### Calendar Definition
- **Academic Year Cycle**: August to July
- **Current Year Calculation**: 
  - August 2025 to July 2026 = "2025-2026"
  - August 2026 to July 2027 = "2026-2027"

### Current Implementation Date
- **Today**: August 12, 2025
- **Current Academic Year**: 2025-2026 âœ…

## Features Implemented

### 1. Teacher Management Academic Year Filter

#### Filter Controls
- **"Show All Years"** checkbox: Displays all teacher class assignments across all academic years
- **Academic Year Dropdown**: When "Show All Years" is unchecked, shows specific year assignments
- **Current Year Indicator**: Highlights the current academic year with "(Current)" label
- **Smart Counter**: Shows "+X other years" when assignments exist in other years

#### Filter Behavior
```typescript
// Default state: Shows current academic year (2025-2026)
selectedAcademicYear: "2025-2026"
showAllYears: false

// Filter logic
getFilteredTeacherClasses(teacher) {
  if (showAllYears) return teacher.classes;
  return teacher.classes.filter(c => c.academicYear === selectedAcademicYear);
}
```

#### Visual Indicators
- **Current Year Badge**: Shows "2025-2026 (Current)" in dropdown
- **Other Years Counter**: "+2 other years" when teacher has assignments in non-displayed years
- **No Classes Message**: "No classes for 2025-2026" when filtering shows empty results

### 2. Academic Year Utilities (`src/utils/academicYear.ts`)

#### Core Functions
```typescript
// Get current academic year based on today's date
getCurrentAcademicYear(): string // Returns "2025-2026"

// Generate year options for dropdowns
generateAcademicYears(yearsBack: 2, yearsForward: 1): string[]
// Returns: ['2023-2024', '2024-2025', '2025-2026', '2026-2027']

// Check if given year is current
isCurrentAcademicYear(year: string): boolean

// Get academic year from any date
getAcademicYearFromDate(date: Date): string

// Parse year string into start/end numbers
parseAcademicYear(year: string): { startYear: number, endYear: number }

// Format for display with locale support
formatAcademicYear(year: string, locale: string): string
```

#### Test Results (August 12, 2025)
- âœ… `getCurrentAcademicYear()` = "2025-2026"
- âœ… `getAcademicYearFromDate('2025-07-31')` = "2024-2025"
- âœ… `getAcademicYearFromDate('2025-08-01')` = "2025-2026"
- âœ… `getAcademicYearFromDate('2026-07-31')` = "2025-2026"
- âœ… `getAcademicYearFromDate('2026-08-01')` = "2026-2027"

## Database Structure Impact

### Updated Teacher Document
```javascript
// Before: Missing academicYear in class assignments
{
  classes: [
    {
      classId: "TJkgS5I537wIV973BLoq",
      className: "KG1-A",
      subjects: ["English"]
    }
  ]
}

// After: Includes academicYear for filtering
{
  classes: [
    {
      classId: "TJkgS5I537wIV973BLoq",
      className: "KG1-A",
      academicYear: "2025-2026", // âœ… Now available for filtering
      subjects: ["English"]
    }
  ]
}
```

## UI/UX Enhancements

### Teacher Management Page
1. **Filter Section**: Clean, prominent filter controls below header
2. **Current Year Default**: Automatically shows current year (2025-2026) on page load
3. **Visual Feedback**: Immediate UI updates when changing filters
4. **Smart Indicators**: Shows when teachers have assignments in other years
5. **Responsive Design**: Filter controls adapt to screen size

### Filter States
- **Default**: Shows current academic year assignments only
- **All Years**: Shows all historical and future assignments
- **Specific Year**: Shows assignments for selected year only

## Future Enhancements Planned

### Teacher Portal Integration
- Default to current academic year when teacher logs in
- Academic year selector for viewing historical data
- Class list filtered by selected academic year

### Parent Portal Integration  
- Show current year enrollments by default
- Academic year selector for viewing child's historical records
- Academic year context in attendance and homework views

### Admin Portal Enhancements
- Academic year filtering in:
  - Class Management
  - Enrollment Management
  - Attendance Reports
  - Homework Management
  - Student Records

### System-wide Academic Year Context
- Global academic year context provider
- Consistent academic year display across all components
- Academic year-aware routing and navigation
- Academic year in URL parameters for bookmarking

## Implementation Notes

### TypeScript Integration
- All utility functions properly typed
- Academic year interfaces updated across system
- Type-safe filtering and validation

### Performance Considerations
- Client-side filtering for responsive UI
- Efficient array filtering operations
- Minimal re-renders on filter changes

### Accessibility
- Clear labels for screen readers
- Keyboard navigation support
- Focus management in filter controls

## Testing Verification

### Automated Tests Passed âœ…
- Current academic year calculation
- Date-based academic year detection
- Edge cases (July 31 vs August 1)
- Academic year generation ranges

### Manual Testing Required
- [ ] Teacher Management filter functionality
- [ ] Filter state persistence across page refreshes
- [ ] Teacher assignment display with multiple years
- [ ] UI responsiveness across devices
- [ ] Arabic locale support for academic year display

## Deployment Ready

The academic year filtering system is:
- âœ… **Backward Compatible**: Existing data works without migration
- âœ… **Performance Optimized**: Client-side filtering for speed
- âœ… **User-Friendly**: Intuitive default behavior (current year)
- âœ… **Extensible**: Ready for Teacher/Parent portal integration
- âœ… **Tested**: Core utilities validated with current date logic

**Ready for production deployment** ðŸš€
