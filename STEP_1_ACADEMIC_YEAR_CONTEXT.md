# Step 1: Global Academic Year Context System Implementation

## Overview
Created a comprehensive academic year management system that can be used across all portals (Admin, Teacher, Parent) for consistent academic year selection and filtering.

## Files Created

### 1. Academic Year Context (`src/contexts/AcademicYearContext.tsx`)
**Purpose**: Global state management for academic year selection

**Features**:
- âœ… Global academic year state across the app
- âœ… Automatic current year detection (2025-2026)
- âœ… Persistence in localStorage
- âœ… TypeScript support with proper interfaces
- âœ… Easy reset to current year functionality

**Key Functions**:
```typescript
// Hook usage
const {
  selectedAcademicYear,    // Currently selected year
  availableYears,          // Array of available years
  isCurrentYear,           // Boolean if current year selected
  setSelectedAcademicYear, // Function to change year
  resetToCurrentYear,      // Function to reset to current
  getCurrentYear,          // Get current academic year
  formatYear              // Format year for display
} = useAcademicYear();
```

### 2. Academic Year Selector Component (`src/components/common/AcademicYearSelector.tsx`)
**Purpose**: Reusable UI component for academic year selection

**Three Variants**:
- **Default**: Full-featured selector with badges and reset button
- **Compact**: Smaller version for headers
- **Minimal**: Inline version for tight spaces

**Features**:
- âœ… Multiple visual variants (default, compact, minimal)
- âœ… Bilingual support (English/Arabic)
- âœ… Current year highlighting
- âœ… Reset to current year button
- âœ… Visual indicators for historical vs current view
- âœ… Responsive design
- âœ… Customizable styling

### 3. Centralized Exports (`src/components/academic-year/index.ts`)
**Purpose**: Single import point for all academic year functionality

```typescript
// Single import for everything
import { 
  AcademicYearProvider, 
  useAcademicYear, 
  AcademicYearSelector 
} from '../components/academic-year';
```

### 4. Test Component (`src/components/test/AcademicYearSystemTest.tsx`)
**Purpose**: Verify all components work correctly

## Usage Examples

### Basic Setup (App Level)
```tsx
// In your main app component or layout
import { AcademicYearProvider } from './components/academic-year';

function App() {
  return (
    <AcademicYearProvider>
      {/* All your portal components */}
      <AdminPortal />
      <TeacherPortal />
      <ParentPortal />
    </AcademicYearProvider>
  );
}
```

### In Any Portal Component
```tsx
import { AcademicYearSelector, useAcademicYear } from '../components/academic-year';

function AdminDashboard() {
  const { selectedAcademicYear } = useAcademicYear();
  
  return (
    <div>
      {/* Academic year selector at top */}
      <AcademicYearSelector locale="en-US" />
      
      {/* Your content filtered by selectedAcademicYear */}
      <TeacherList academicYear={selectedAcademicYear} />
      <ClassList academicYear={selectedAcademicYear} />
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Different Variants
```tsx
// Full selector for main areas
<AcademicYearSelector locale="en-US" />

// Compact for headers
<AcademicYearSelector variant="compact" locale="en-US" />

// Minimal for inline use
<AcademicYearSelector variant="minimal" locale="en-US" />

// Arabic locale
<AcademicYearSelector locale="ar-SA" />
```

## Key Benefits

### 1. **Consistency Across Portals**
- Same UI component used everywhere
- Consistent behavior and appearance
- Unified academic year logic

### 2. **Automatic Current Year Detection**
- No manual updates needed for new academic years
- Current year (2025-2026) automatically detected
- Smart defaults based on current date

### 3. **Persistence**
- Selected year saved in localStorage
- Maintains selection across browser sessions
- Restores last selected year on app reload

### 4. **Developer Experience**
- Simple hook-based API
- TypeScript support with proper types
- Easy to extend and customize
- Clear component variants for different use cases

### 5. **User Experience**
- Visual indicators for current vs historical view
- Quick reset to current year
- Bilingual support
- Responsive design

## Current Status
âœ… **Step 1 Complete**: Global academic year context system implemented

## Next Steps (Step 2)
- Integrate with existing portals (Admin, Teacher, Parent)
- Update existing components to use the global context
- Add academic year filtering to data fetching functions
- Test across all portals

## Testing
To test the system:
1. Import and use `AcademicYearSystemTest` component
2. Verify all three variants display correctly
3. Test year selection and context updates
4. Verify persistence across page refreshes
5. Test both English and Arabic locales

The foundation is now ready for system-wide academic year filtering! ðŸŽ‰
