# Activity Logging System

The activity logging system tracks user actions across the admin portal to provide a comprehensive audit trail and recent activity feed.

## Overview

The system has been updated to:
- Remove pending fees and monthly revenue from dashboard statistics
- Display real-time statistics for: Total Students, Total Teachers, Total Parents, Total Classes
- Implement a comprehensive activity logging system
- Show recent activities with proper icons and formatting

## Files Modified/Created

### Updated Files:
1. **`types/admin.types.ts`** - Enhanced RecentActivity interface with better typing
2. **`services/api.ts`** - Added systemAPI for statistics and activityAPI for activity management
3. **`components/dashboard/AdminDashboard.tsx`** - Updated to use real data and enhanced UI
4. **`data/mockData.ts`** - Updated mock data structure (used as fallback)

### New Files:
1. **`utils/activityLogger.ts`** - Comprehensive activity logging utilities

## Usage

### Using the Activity Logger

```typescript
import { ActivityLogger } from '../utils/activityLogger';
import { useAuth } from '../hooks/useAuth';

// In your component
const { user } = useAuth();

// Log user creation
await ActivityLogger.logUserCreated(user, 'John Doe', 'user123');

// Log student enrollment
await ActivityLogger.logEnrollmentCreated(user, 'Ahmed Ali', 'KG1-A', 'enrollment456');

// Log class update
await ActivityLogger.logClassUpdated(user, 'KG2-B', 'class789');
```

### Manual Activity Logging

```typescript
import { logActivity } from '../utils/activityLogger';

await logActivity({
  user,
  type: 'custom_action',
  description: 'Custom action performed',
  targetId: 'target123',
  targetName: 'Target Name',
  metadata: { customData: 'value' }
});
```

## Features

### Dashboard Statistics
- **Real-time Data**: Statistics are fetched from actual system data
- **Fallback Support**: Shows 0 values if API calls fail
- **Refresh Button**: Manual refresh capability for both statistics and activities

### Activity Feed
- **Real-time Activities**: Shows latest 10 activities by default
- **Rich Display**: Includes user info, timestamps, and target objects
- **Type-specific Icons**: Different icons and colors for different activity types
- **Internationalization**: Supports both English and Arabic

### Activity Types Supported
- User Management: create, update, delete
- Student Management: create, update, delete
- Class Management: create, update, delete
- Enrollment Management: create, update, delete
- Teacher Assignments: assign, unassign
- Attendance: record
- System: login, logout, backup

## API Endpoints

The system expects these Firebase Cloud Functions:
- `getRecentActivities` - Get paginated list of recent activities
- `logActivity` - Log a new activity (internal use)
- `listUsers` - Get users by role
- `listStudents` - Get all students
- `manageClasses` - Get all classes

## Next Steps

1. **Implement Backend**: Create the corresponding Firebase Cloud Functions
2. **Add Real-time Updates**: Consider using Firestore listeners for live updates
3. **Enhanced Filtering**: Add date range and activity type filters
4. **Export Functionality**: Allow exporting activity logs
5. **Notifications**: Add real-time notifications for important activities

## Error Handling

The system gracefully handles errors by:
- Showing fallback data (mock data or empty states)
- Logging errors to console for debugging
- Not disrupting main application flow if activity logging fails
- Providing user-friendly error messages in the UI
